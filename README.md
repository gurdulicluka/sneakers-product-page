# Sneakers Product Page

ðŸ”— [Live Deployment](https://sneakers-ecommerce-buildv1.netlify.app/) on Netlify

A product page challenge from [FrontendMentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).
<br>
This was my first solution that I developed using `React.js`.
<br>

## What I've learned

I have tried to follow the classic folder structure and architecture for a React app, which means splitting the app into encapsulated functional components, for that is one of the main purposes of the library.
<br>

- State management with `CONTEXT API` for the cart and input components.
- Deeper understanding of `hooks`, especially `useRef()`.
- State logic and event handling with `reducers`.
- CSS modules for dynamic styling

## Notes

I don't consider this little project completed yet, because I've learned a lot more about cleaner code design and React.js in general since then. I would like to come back one day and fix some functionalities and perhaps add a full product list page and expand the website.<br>
Nonetheless, I am still proud of this little nugget of a website I built because I fell in love with React.js doing it and got introduced to many other new technologies/tools.
